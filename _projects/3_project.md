For my Data Science Capstone project, I worked with Adobe Analytics to improve the standard time-to-read model of 240 wpm.  This naive model doesn't take any factors into account, other than the length of the article.  We conducted a statistical study on Mechanical Turk using fractional factorial design to gather data, then used machine learning techniques to improve upon the naive model.

Abstract:
In order to help its Web Analytics clients create beter online written content, Adobe wanted to more acurately predict the average time-to-read for a wide range of written content. The industry-standard metrics,(such as time-on-page and the “standard” reading speed of 240 words per minute), do not reliably predict reading time for the various types of  online and written content available today.  We first used fractional factorial survey design to crowdsource data on Mechanical Turk and then created an improved 8-factor model that more accurately predicts time-to-read for various types of writen content.
