I'm an undergraduate student at Brigham Young University studying Computer Science and Statistics. I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning: my current research includes natural language understanding, machine learning for NLP, and model evaluation.

I've had the privilege to work with several professors during my undergraduate experience: [Prof. Kevin Seppi](https://byu-aml.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} on natural language understanding and meta-learning, with [Prof. Nancy Fulda](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/neo){:target="\_blank"} doing natural language generation and with [Prof. Quinn Snell](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/snell/){:target="\_blank"} doing computational health research into suicide prevention.

I interned with the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) for the first part of 2020, where I worked on machine reading and analyzed transfer learning. I was advised by [Matt Gardner](https://matt-gardner.github.io/) and [Sameer Singh](http://sameersingh.org/) and worked with many other great researchers.

I'm currently working with Apple's Machine Intelligence division for the summer of 2020, researching machine translation with [Matthias Sperber](http://msperber.com/).
