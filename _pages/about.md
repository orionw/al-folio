I'm an incoming first-year PhD student at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University. Previously I graduated with my Bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University in computer science and statistics, where I was advised by [Kevin Seppi](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/kevin-seppi/) and [Quinn Snell](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/quinn-snell/). I am broadly interested in natural language processing and machine learning. 

I interned with Apple AI/ML in the summers of 2020 and 2021, researching machine translation with [Matthias Sperber](http://msperber.com/). 

I have also interned with the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), where I worked with [Matt Gardner](https://matt-gardner.github.io/) and [Matthew Peters](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K5nCPZwAAAAJ&hl=en) on transfer learning problems. 

If you're interested in getting in contact with me, please email me at {last_name}{first_name}@gmail.com.
