I'm an undergraduate student at Brigham Young University studying Computer Science and Statistics.  My research interests include Machine Learning and Computational Linguistics. My current research interests include natural language generation, natural language inference, and question answering.

I've had the privilege to work with several professors over my undergraduate experience: I worked with [Prof. Kevin Seppi](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/kseppi){:target="\_blank"} doing natural langauge processing and metalearning, with [Prof. Quinn Snell](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/snell/){:target="\_blank"} doing computational health research into mental health and suicide prevention, and with [Prof. Nancy Fulda](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/neo){:target="\_blank"} with natural language generation.

If you're interested in getting in contact with me, please email me at {last_name}{first_name}@gmail.com.
