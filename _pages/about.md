I'm an undergraduate senior at Brigham Young University studying computer science and statistics. I am broadly interested in natural language processing and machine learning. I am currently funded by the [Goldwater Scholarship.](https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/)

I've had the privilege to work with several professors during my undergraduate experience: [Prof. Kevin Seppi](https://byu-aml.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} on natural language understanding and meta-learning, with [Prof. Nancy Fulda](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/neo){:target="\_blank"} doing natural language generation and with [Prof. Quinn Snell](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/snell/){:target="\_blank"} doing computational health research into suicide prevention.

I interned with the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) for the first part of 2020, where I worked on robust NLP and analyzed transfer learning. I was advised by [Matt Gardner](https://matt-gardner.github.io/) and [Sameer Singh](http://sameersingh.org/) and worked with many other great researchers. I then spent the summer working with Apple's AI/ML division, researching machine translation with [Matthias Sperber](http://msperber.com/).

If you're interested in getting in contact with me, please email me at {last_name}{first_name}@gmail.com.
