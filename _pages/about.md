I'm an undergraduate student at Brigham Young University studying Computer Science and Statistics.  I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning: my current research interests include natural language generation, natural language inference, and question answering.

I've had the privilege to work with several professors over my undergraduate experience: I'm currently working with [Prof. Kevin Seppi](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/kseppi){:target="\_blank"} doing natural langauge processing and metalearning, with [Prof. Quinn Snell](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/snell/){:target="\_blank"} doing computational health research into suicide prevention, and with [Prof. Nancy Fulda](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/neo){:target="\_blank"} doing natural language generation.

If you're interested in getting in contact with me, please email me at {last_name}{first_name}@gmail.com.
