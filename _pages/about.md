I'm an undergraduate student at Brigham Young University studying Computer Science and Statistics.  I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning: my current research explorations include meta-learning for NLP, natural language generation, and natural language understanding.

I've had the privilege to work with several professors during my undergraduate experience: [Prof. Kevin Seppi](https://byu-aml.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} on natural language understanding and meta-learning, with [Prof. Nancy Fulda](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/neo){:target="\_blank"} doing natural language generation and with [Prof. Quinn Snell](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/snell/){:target="\_blank"} doing computational health research into suicide prevention.

I am currently interning at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) for the first half of 2020, where I am working on question answering and meta-learning problems.  I am fortunate to be advised by [Matt Gardner](https://matt-gardner.github.io/) and work with many other great researchers.

If you're interested in getting in contact with me, please email me at {last_name}{first_name}@gmail.com.
