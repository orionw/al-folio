I'm a first-year PhD student at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/) and [Dawn Lawrie](https://hltcoe.jhu.edu/researcher/dawn-lawrie/). I am broadly interested in natural language processing and machine learning. My research is graciously supported by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Previously I graduated with my Bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University in computer science and statistics, where I was advised by [Kevin Seppi](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/kevin-seppi/) and [Quinn Snell](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/quinn-snell/).

In the past, I've spent time interning with several great mentors: with [Matthias Sperber](http://msperber.com/) at Apple AI/ML in summer 2020 and 2021 and with [Matt Gardner](https://matt-gardner.github.io/) and [Matthew Peters](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K5nCPZwAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) in the first half of 2020.

If you're interested in getting in contact with me, please email me at {last_name}{first_name}@gmail.com.
