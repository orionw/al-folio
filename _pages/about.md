I'm a third-year PhD student at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/) and [Dawn Lawrie](https://hltcoe.jhu.edu/researcher/dawn-lawrie/). I am broadly interested in natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and machine learning (ML). My research is graciously supported by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

My current research is situated between the NLP and IR fields, where I work to improve how models find, understand, and generate information. Some examples include improving model's factuality, attribution, or ability to handle distribution shifts.

Previously I graduated with my Bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University in computer science and statistics, where I was advised by [Kevin Seppi](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/kevin-seppi/) and [Quinn Snell](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/quinn-snell/).

In the past, I've spent time interning with many excellent mentors: at [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) in AI2 working with [Luca Soldaini](https://soldaini.net/), [Kyle Lo](https://kyleclo.github.io/), and [Arman Cohan](https://armancohan.com/) in 2023, at Apple AI/ML with [Matthias Sperber](http://msperber.com/) in 2020 and 2021, and at AllenNLP/AI2 with [Matt Gardner](https://matt-gardner.github.io/) and [Matthew Peters](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K5nCPZwAAAAJ&hl=en) in 2020.
