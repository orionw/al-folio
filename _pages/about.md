I'm an undergraduate student at Brigham Young University studying Computer Science and Statistics.  I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning: my current research explorations include natural language generation and natural language understanding.

I've had the privilege to work with several professors during my undergraduate experience: I'm currently working with [Prof. Kevin Seppi](https://byu-aml.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} on natural language understanding tasks and with [Prof. Nancy Fulda](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/neo){:target="\_blank"} doing natural language generation.  I previously worked with [Prof. Quinn Snell](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/snell/){:target="\_blank"} doing computational health research into suicide prevention.

If you're interested in getting in contact with me, please email me at {last_name}{first_name}@gmail.com.
